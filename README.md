# cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the cypress basic course from Talking About Testing school.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project. 

> I used versions `v20.10.0` e `v20.10.0` of Node.js and npm, respectively and I suggest you to use the same or use the later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (ou `npm i`) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

It's possible to run the tests simulating desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for short version) to run the tests in headless mode on a desktop viewport. 

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress to run the tests in interative mode on a desktop viewport. 

### Mobile

Run `npm run test:mobile` to run the tests in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress to run the tests in interative mode on a mobile viewport.
